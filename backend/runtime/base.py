"""Abstract :class:`TaskRuntime` and :class:`RuntimeResult`.

Common interface for executing scripts / inline snippets under a
:class:`SandboxPolicy`. The current runtime ships a host (in-process)
implementation; future flavours (docker, e2b, firecracker) can plug into
the same protocol so the call sites in ``pre_script`` / ``code_execution``
the same protocol.

Interface intentionally narrow: ``execute(kind, payload, policy, ...)``
returns a :class:`RuntimeResult` and never raises into the caller —
every failure path (policy violation, missing interpreter, timeout,
process crash) becomes ``ok=False`` with an ``error`` string. Callers
are free to ignore stdout / stderr / exit_code when they only need the
yes/no answer.
