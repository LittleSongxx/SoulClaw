"""memory_manage: agent-facing CRUD for cross-session memory (v0.12 + v0.15).

Confirm-tier so every write is gated by the v0.6 IM yes/no flow — the
LLM cannot quietly seed its own system prompt without the operator's
sign-off. Seven actions:

* ``remember``    — add a new entry (gated by injection scanner)
* ``recall``      — search by query (read-only; the v0.9 review fork
                    invokes this freely via the trust-confirm bypass)
* ``forget``      — remove a single entry by id
* ``list``        — dump all active entries (optionally filtered by kind)
* ``pin``         — mark entry sacred (curator + autonomous code can't
                    touch it)
* ``unpin``       — release the lock
* ``consolidate`` — v0.15: archive near-duplicate entries (deterministic
                    similarity + provenance ranking, never touches
                    pinned / explicit-vs-review)

Tool description doubles as guidance to the LLM about *when* to write a
memory vs leaving the moment alone — the same conservative stance as
the v0.9 review prompt: "do nothing" is the most common right answer.
